# Thanks

I would like to thank my supervisor Wolfgang Schreiner for his continous advice and suggestions throughout numerous revisions. He gave me the opportunity to realise the master thesis of my dreams. Thanks. I have learned a lot from you. 

I would also like to thank my friends and my girlfriend for this lovely time I had at university. I would not have been able to finish my degree if it would not have been without your love and support. It was a great time.

Last but not least, a big thanks to my family. I am privileged to have you all.
