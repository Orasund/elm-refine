# Formal definition of Elm

First, we define some notations:

* $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of the natural numbers starting from $1$.
* $\mathbb{N}_0$ is the set of the natural numbers starting from $0$.
* $\mathbb{N}_a^b:=\{i\in \mathbb{N}_0 | a \leq i \land i \leq b\}$ is the set of the natural numbers between $a$ and $b$.
* We will use "$.$" to separate a quantifier from a statement: $\forall a . F$ and $\exists a . F$, where $a$ is a variable and $F$ is a formula.
* Function types will be written as $a_1 \to \dots \to a_n \to b$ instead of $a_1 \times \dots \times a_n \to b$, thus an n-ary function is represented as a unary function whoes result is a (n-1)-ary function. This concept is called "currying".
* We allow the use of lambda notation for functions, i.e. $\lambda x.T$ denotes the function $f$ defined by the equation $f(x) = T$ where $T$ is a term.
