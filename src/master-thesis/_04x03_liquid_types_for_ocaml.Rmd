### Liquid Types for Eager Languages

The idea behind liquid types can be summerized in three points:




## Liquid Types for Haskell

In the paper _Refinement types for Haskell_ by Vazou, Seidel and Jhala [@RT_for_Haskell] they describe their implementation in Haskell and the theory behind it. For an eager langauges, like OCamel, we may assume that any free variable will be bound to a value. Therefore one can typically restrain the free variable according to the refinement of the value. For lazy langauges like Haskell or Elm this assumption is wrong: a free variable can be bound by different values of different types. Therefore the refinement must be context dependent.
