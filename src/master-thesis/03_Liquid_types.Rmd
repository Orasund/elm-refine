# Liquid types

First, we define some notations:

* $\mathbb{N}$ are the natural numbers starting from $1$.
* $\mathbb{N}_0$ are the natural numbers starting from $0$.
* $\mathbb{N}_a^b:=\{i\in \mathbb{N}_0 | a \leq i \land i \leq b\}$ are the natural numbers between $a$ and $b$.
* We'll use "$.$" to separate a quantifier from a statement: $\forall a . b$ and $\exists a . b$.
* Function types will be written as $a_1 \to \dots \to a_n \to b$ instead of $a_1 \times \dots \times a_n \to b$.
