# State of the art

In 1902, Bertrand Russell wrote Gottlob Frege a letter, pointing out a paradox in Gottlob's _Begriffsschrift_ [@Frege]. Up until this point mathematicians expected that everything could be grouped in sets, as initially demonstrated by Georg Cantor in 1874 [@Cantor]. Russell's paradox gave a contradiction to this assumption:

Given the set of all sets that do not contain themselfs $R = \{x|x\not \in x\}$, then $R\in R$ and $R\not\in R$.

To fix this problem, Russell added a basic theory of types in the appendix of _pricipia mathematica_ [@Principia_Mathematica], that at the time was currently in the printer. This rushed theory was not perfect, but it marks the first appearance of type theory.

# Type Theory

The main idea behind type theory is that every element has exactly one type. This means that once the type of an element is given, it can not change. This is a big difference to sets, where elements can live in any amount of different sets.

Russells original theory had the type of functions not only depend on the types of its arguments but also on any type that is used in the definition of the function. Thus the type of a functions could get very complicated even for simple functions.

In 1921 Leon Chwistek and Frank Ramsey noticed that if one would allow recursive type definitions, the complexity could be avoided. This new theory is general referred as _simple type theory_, tough its still far from simple.
